abstract="This paper presents a new cost-effective, adaptive multichannel filter taking advantage of switching schemes, robust order-statistic theory and approximation of the multivariate dispersion. Introducing the statistical control of the switching between the vector median and the identity operation, the developed filter enhances the detail-preserving capability of the standard vector median filter. The analysis and experimental results reported in this paper indicate that the proposed method is capable of detecting and removing impulsive noise in multichannel images. At the same time, the method is computationally efficient and provides excellent balance between the noise attenuation and signal-detail preservation. Excellent performance of the proposed method is tested using standard test color images as well as real images related to emerging virtual restoration of artworks.",

abstract="Cancerous mass detection methods for mammographic images still miss some malignant cases on the one hand, and produce too many false-positive (FP) detections with respect to the number of true-positive (TP) detections on the other. An attempt has been described to improve the TP ratio per image and to decrease the number of FP errors in the hierarchical template matching detector of regions of interest (ROIs) for cancerous masses by eliminating the images of linear structures (LSs) from the mammograms. The LSs were detected with an accumulation-based line detector. The measure of correctness of the ROIs detection was discussed and the quality of the detector, represented by free receiver operating characteristics curves, was compared with the human-eye observations. The result is that the widely used measure of detection correctness seems to underestimate the detection quality made by a human. Tests were performed on the mammograms from the MIAS database.",
